Gradle Enterprise provides:
* Build Scans
* Built-in build cache node

You can control when build scans are published:
* only for CI
* only for devs
* only when failed
* preferred is to just publish all if possible

The build scan plugin does not integrate with SCM, but we can use tags for it
Can link back to BUILD_URL for Jenkins build
Display a dirtly label if local changes were made
Display git status
More examples: https://blog.gradle.org/custom-data-in-build-scans
Can contact them to get the checkstyle example and they will make it available.
