/*
    1. Write a custom task class of type `Greeting`. 
		- Add a property `greeting` for the greeting text. 
		- Assign a default value to it.
        - The task action should print the greeting text property. 
		- Add two tasks to your build script, both of type `Greeting`.
        - One should assign a custom value to the greeting property. 
		- Execute both tasks.
       
    2. Is there an alternative to using an annotation for adding a task action to a custom task?
