/*
    1. Add an extra property `license` to all Zip tasks.
    2. Set the license property for a couple of zips.
    3. Add an extra method `isOpenSource` to all Zip tasks. The method should return `true` if the zip has an open source license.
    4. Add a task `openSourceZips` that builds all the zips that have an open source license.
    5. Add another task `showOpenSourceZips` that prints out all zip tasks that have an open source license.
    6. (Optional) Extract the code that enhances the Zip task into a script plugin. This plugin should also add an extra property `allOpenSourceZips` to the project object.
    7. (Optional) Extract the code of the script plugin into a binary plugin.
