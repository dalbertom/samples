    1. Import the Ant build and run it from Gradle.
    2. Add a `println` before and after the Ant target gets executed.
    3. Instead of importing the Ant build, implement a Gradle task that uses the Ant checksum task.

        Hint: To access an Ant property named `foo`, use `ant.properties.foo` or `ant.foo`.
