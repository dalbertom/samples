/*
    Background: This build has two tasks, `commonsMath` and `buildSource`. Both tasks have actions which use external code.
    `commonsMath` requires `org.apache.commons:commons-math:2.1` from Maven Central. `buildSource` requires the binaries of the Java class `input/Decorator.java`.

    1. Try to execute the task `commonsMath`. Gradle will tell you that the build script does not compile. The same happens if you execute `buildSource`.
    2. Add the necessary classes to the build script class path. Assuming `Decorator.java` is only used in this build, what's the best way to get it on the build script class path?

    3. (optional) Create a separate build for `Decorator.java`. Publish its Jar to the local Maven repository, and make the other build consume it from there.
    4. (optional) Instead of the local Maven repository, use a (local) Ivy repository to share the Jar.

        Hints:

        1. Use the `maven` plugin to publish to the local Maven repository (see the user guide for more information). Don't forget to declare the local Maven repository in the consuming build.
        2. Publishing and consuming from a local Ivy repository works just like for a remote Ivy repository, except that the repository has a `file:///` URL.
