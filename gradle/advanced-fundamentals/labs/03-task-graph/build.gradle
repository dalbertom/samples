/*
    1. Add a task `moreGreetings` that depends on the `hello` task. Execute both `date` and `moreGreetings` in a single run.
    2. Add a task `setup`, on which `date` should depend. Execute `date`.
    3. Change the order of execution of `hello` and `setup`, by specifying either of them as the first task to be executed (on the command line).
    4. Discuss: Would it be OK to say `gradle date setup`? What would be the effect?
    5. Declare and configure 'date' task before 'hello'. Run the build and inspect the failure. Fix the problem
    See the DSL reference of Task.dependsOn method to find out what arguments are accepted.
